//Syntax to store the data in JavaScript 
// declaration variable = data ;

//Operator : Operators are nothing but a set of special characters used in JavaScript to perform different types of operations. 


//Based on the nature of the operation that we are going to complete, we can divide these operators into five different categories. 

//1. Arithmetic Operators
//2. Assignment Operators
//3. Comparison Operators
//4. Logical Operators
//5. Ternary Operator


//1. Arithmetic Operators => Arithmetic operators are a set of special characters used to perform mathematical operations. 
/* +  => Addition
-  => Subtraction
*  => Multiplication
/  => Division
%  => Modulus
++ => Increment (+1 Increase the original value by one. )
-- => Decrement (-1 Decrease the original value by one. ) */

let a = 40;
let b = 10;

// ++ always going to increase the value by one, -- always going to decrease the value by one, but the placement of ++ and -- will decide when to update. 

// If ++ written after variable, First execute the line.Next increase the value. (post-increment)
// If ++ written before variable, First increase the value, then execute the line. (pre-increment)
console.log("Arithmetic operator");

console.log(a++);
console.log(--b);


//2. Assignment Operators => Assignment operators are a set of special characters used to assign values to variables.

/* =
+=
-=
*=
/=
%= */

console.log("Assignment operator");
let i = 10;
console.log(i);

i += 5; // i = i+5; // Increase the value by 5
console.log(i);//15

i -= 5; // i= i-5 ; Decrease the value by 5
console.log(i);//10

i *= 5; // i = i*5 ; Multiply the original value by 5. 
console.log(i); //50

i /= 5; // i= i/5 ; Divide by 5. 
console.log(i);//10

i %= 5;
console.log(i);//0

//3. Comparison Operators => Set of special characters used to compare two different values 
/* == , === , > , <, >= , <= , != , !==
== Represents loose equality, meaning compare only data. 
=== Represents strict equality, meaning compare data along with data type.  */

console.log("comparison operator");
let x = 10;
let y = 10;
let z = "10"; //string (The number inside the quotations will represent text, not a number. )

console.log(x == z);
console.log(x === z);

console.log(x != z);
console.log(x !== z);

console.log(x + y);
console.log(x + z);

//4. Logical Operators => Logical operators are all about a set of special characters used to combine two or more conditions. 
// && => Logical AND => Returns true if all conditions are true.
// || => Logical OR => Returns true if at least one condition is true.
// !  => Logical NOT

let p = 10;
let q = 20;
let r = 30;
console.log("logical operator");
console.log(p < q && q > r && p < r); // true and false  = false
console.log(p < q || q > r); // true or false = true
console.log(!(p < q || q > r)); // !(true or false) = !true = false

//5. Ternary Operator => Ternary operator is a special character used to perform conditional operations.
//Syntax : let result = (condition) ? value-if-true : value-if-false;

let age = 27;

let result = (age > 18 || age == 18) ? "Eligible to Vote" : "Not Eligible to Vote";

console.log(result);
